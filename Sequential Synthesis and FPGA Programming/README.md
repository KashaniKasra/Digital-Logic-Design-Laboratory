## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Sequential Synthesis and FPGA Programming**. The main objective is to design and implement a **Multi-channel Serial Transmitter** (MSSD) using Finite State Machines (FSMs) and related components on an FPGA. The design includes concepts such as state machines, sequence detectors, and synthesis.

## Key Components

### 1. Multi-channel Serial Transmitter (MSSD)
The MSSD is a synchronous communication demultiplexer. It receives serial input, decodes the data, and routes it to specific output ports.
   - Transmission is initiated when a bit transition (1 to 0) is detected. The serial data stream includes the destination port, data size, and the data itself.

### 2. RTL Design
   - **Onepulser**: Generates a clock enable signal used for controlling the system clock in the FPGA.
   - **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: Implements the control logic for handling the serial data stream and routing it to the appropriate output port.
   - **Shift Registers & Demultiplexer**: Shift registers are used for storing port numbers and data bits, and the demultiplexer selects the appropriate output channel.
   - **Seven-Segment Display**: Displays the number of data bits transmitted to the selected port.

### 3. FPGA Implementation
The design is synthesized and implemented on an FPGA development board (Cyclone II). Inputs such as the serial data and clock are provided through the boardâ€™s switches and push-buttons. LEDs and a seven-segment display are used to show data transmission status and results.

## Deliverables
- Simulation results for various components like the one-pulser, FSM, and shift registers.
- Verilog code for each module.
- Synthesis report and FPGA resource utilization.
- Demonstration of the MSSD design implemented on the FPGA.

This project is part of a laboratory course at the University of Tehran, supervised by Professor Zain Navabi.
