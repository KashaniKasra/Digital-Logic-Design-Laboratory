## Key Components

### 1. Clock Generation using ICs and Analog Components
The experiment covers multiple methods of generating clock signals, including:
- **Ring Oscillator**: Uses a chain of inverters to generate periodic signals and measure gate propagation delay.
- **LM555 Timer**: Configured in astable mode to generate a rectangular pulse with a specific frequency and duty cycle.
- **Schmitt Trigger Oscillator**: Produces oscillations using the 74HCT14 inverter.
- **Synchronous Counter**: Used to divide the frequency of the generated clock signal.

### 2. Flip-Flops
The project explores the use of T Flip-Flops and D Flip-Flops, demonstrating how to achieve a 50% duty cycle signal.

## Deliverables
- Construction of various oscillators and clock generation circuits.
- Measurements of clock frequencies and duty cycles.
- Implementation of frequency dividers and flip-flop-based circuits.

This project was developed as part of the Digital Logic Laboratory at the University of Tehran, under the supervision of Professor Zain Navabi.
